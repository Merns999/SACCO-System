SACCO, Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization

## Project Overview
A Sacco is a type of financial institution that operates on the principles of cooperative ownership and mutual support. It is a member-owned organization where individuals with a common bond, such as belonging to the same profession, community, or workplace, come together to pool their savings and provide credit and other financial services to their members.
We did a class project, which is a web-based SACCO management system developed using C# and .NET Framework for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The system allows SACCO members to manage their accounts, make transactions, and access various financial services.
